As Software Crafters, we improve professional software development skills through practice and helping others learn the know-how.

We do appreciate the following:

    Not only working software, but also well-crafted software.
    Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value.
    Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals.
    Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships.

Looking for the left parts, we found that we needed the right parts.

See the Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/ for more on that.
