As Software Crafters, we improve professional software development skills through
practice and by helping others learn the know-how.

We value the following:

> Not only working software, but also well-crafted software.  
> Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value.  
> Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals.  
> Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships.  

Looking for the left parts, we found that we needed the right parts.
